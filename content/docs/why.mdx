# Why GP-Grid?

GP-Grid is designed from the ground up for performance, simplicity, and developer experience with no feature gating.

## Performance First

### Virtual Scrolling That Actually Works

Most grids claim virtual scrolling, but struggle with millions of rows. GP-Grid uses a unique **slot-based architecture** that maintains consistent 60fps performance regardless of dataset size.

See our [detailed benchmarks](/docs/benchmarks) comparing GP-Grid against other popular grid libraries.

### How It Works

Instead of creating and destroying DOM nodes as you scroll, GP-Grid recycles a fixed pool of "slots". This means:

- **Constant memory usage** - No matter how many rows you have
- **No garbage collection pauses** - DOM nodes are reused, not discarded
- **Smooth scrolling** - No jank from element creation

## TypeScript Native

GP-Grid is written entirely in TypeScript with modern tooling (tsdown, rolldown, etc) and strict type checking. You get:

- Full type inference for your data
- Autocomplete for all props and methods
- Compile-time error checking
- No `@types` packages needed

```tsx
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

// Full type safety
const columns: ColumnDefinition[] = [
  { field: "id", cellDataType: "number", width: 80 },
  { field: "name", cellDataType: "text", width: 200 },
  { field: "email", cellDataType: "text", width: 250 },
];

// TypeScript knows your data shape
<Grid<User> columns={columns} rowData={users} rowHeight={36} />
```

## Framework Agnostic Core

The core logic is completely separated from UI rendering. This means:

- **Consistent behavior** across React and Vue
- **Easy to add new frameworks** - The adapter layer is thin
- **Battle-tested core** - One codebase, multiple implementations

## Lightweight

GP-Grid is significantly smaller than alternatives:

| Library | ReactJS Bundle Size (gzip) |
|---------|-------------------|
| GP-Grid | ~90 kB |
| AG-Grid | ~21 MB+ |
| Handsontable | ~434 kB+ |

No bloat. No unused features. Just what you need.

## Simple API

No complex configuration objects. No steep learning curve.

```tsx
// That's it. A working grid.
<Grid
  columns={columns}
  rowData={data}
  rowHeight={36}
/>
```

Compare this to competitors that require pages of configuration.

## Features When You Need Them

- **Sorting** - Click headers, hold Shift for multi-sort
- **Filtering** - Built-in filter popup with operators
- **Selection** - Cell, range, and multi-select
- **Editing** - Inline editing with fill handle
- **Keyboard** - Full keyboard navigation
- **Dark mode** - One prop to toggle

## Open Source

GP-Grid is Apache 2.0 licensed and free for commercial use. No enterprise tiers, no feature gating.
