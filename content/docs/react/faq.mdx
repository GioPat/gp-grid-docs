# FAQ

Frequently asked questions about gp-grid-react.

## General

### What browsers are supported?

gp-grid supports all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Edge 88+
- Firefox 78+
- Safari 14+

### Is gp-grid free to use?

Yes, gp-grid is open source and free to use in both personal and commercial projects.

### What's the maximum dataset size?

There's no practical limit. The virtual scrolling architecture means performance is consistent regardless of dataset size. We've tested with 2 million rows.

## Performance

### Why is my grid slow to render?

Common causes:

1. **Not using memoization**: Wrap `rowData` in `useMemo`:
   ```tsx
   const rows = useMemo(() => data.map(transform), [data]);
   ```

2. **Heavy custom renderers**: Keep renderers simple, pre-compute values.

3. **Too many columns**: Consider horizontal virtualization for 50+ columns.

### How do I improve scroll performance?

- Increase `overscan` for smoother scrolling (at cost of more DOM nodes)
- Simplify custom renderers
- Ensure container has explicit dimensions

## Styling

### How do I enable dark mode?

Use the `darkMode` prop:

```tsx
<Grid darkMode={true} ... />
```

For theme integration (e.g., next-themes), see the [Styling Guide](/docs/react/guides/styling).

### How do I customize the grid appearance?

Override CSS classes in your global styles. Common classes include `.gp-grid-header`, `.gp-grid-cell--active`, and `.gp-grid-row`. For complete styling options including Tailwind CSS and custom renderers, see the [Styling Guide](/docs/react/guides/styling).

## Data

### How do I update a single cell?

Use a mutable data source:

```tsx
const dataSource = createMutableClientDataSource(data, {
  getRowId: (row) => row.id,
});

dataSource.updateCell(rowId, "fieldName", newValue);
```

### How do I refresh data from the server?

For server data sources, the grid automatically fetches when sort/filter changes. For manual refresh, recreate the data source:

```tsx
const [key, setKey] = useState(0);

// Refresh
setKey(k => k + 1);

return <Grid key={key} dataSource={dataSource} ... />;
```

### Can I use async data loading?

Yes, use `createServerDataSource` which accepts an async function.

## Features

### Does gp-grid support column resizing?

Column resizing is on the roadmap. Currently, columns have fixed widths defined in the column definition.

### Does gp-grid support row grouping?

Row grouping is planned for a future release.

### Can I export to Excel/CSV?

Export functionality is not built-in. You can access the data source and implement export yourself:

```tsx
const exportToCSV = () => {
  const rows = dataSource.getAllRows(); // Your implementation
  // Convert to CSV and download
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Grid shows no data

1. Check that `rowData` or `dataSource` is provided
2. Verify the container has explicit height
3. Check browser console for errors

### Cells don't render correctly

1. Ensure `field` in column definition matches property name in data
2. Check `cellDataType` matches actual data type

### Sorting doesn't work

1. Verify `sortingEnabled` is not set to `false`
2. Check column has `sortable: true` (default)
3. For server-side data, ensure server handles sort request
