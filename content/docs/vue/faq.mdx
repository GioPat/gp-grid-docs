# FAQ

Frequently asked questions about gp-grid-vue.

## General

### Does gp-grid work with Vue 2?

No, gp-grid-vue requires Vue 3.3 or higher. Vue 2 is not supported.

### Does it work with Nuxt 3?

Yes, gp-grid works great with Nuxt 3. See the [Nuxt Integration](/docs/vue/nuxt) guide.

### Is TypeScript required?

No, but strongly recommended. gp-grid includes built-in TypeScript definitions.

## Reactivity

### Why isn't my grid updating?

1. **Using `shallowRef`**: You need to replace the entire array:
   ```ts
   data.value = [...data.value, newItem];  // Works
   data.value.push(newItem);  // Won't trigger update
   ```

2. **Using `ref`**: Should work automatically, check console for errors.

3. **Using mutable data source**: Make sure to call the mutation methods:
   ```ts
   dataSource.addRows([newItem]);  // Correct
   ```

### How do I force a refresh?

```vue
<script setup>
const key = ref(0);

function refresh() {
  key.value++;
}
</script>

<template>
  <Grid :key="key" ... />
</template>
```

## SSR / Nuxt

### Why do I get hydration errors?

gp-grid requires browser APIs. Wrap it in `<ClientOnly>`:

```vue
<template>
  <ClientOnly>
    <Grid ... />
  </ClientOnly>
</template>
```

### How do I show a loading state during SSR?

```vue
<template>
  <ClientOnly>
    <Grid ... />
    <template #fallback>
      <div class="h-[500px] animate-pulse bg-gray-200" />
    </template>
  </ClientOnly>
</template>
```

## Styling

### How do I override styles in scoped CSS?

Use `:deep()`:

```vue
<style scoped>
:deep(.gp-grid-header) {
  background: blue;
}
</style>
```

## Performance

### Is there a row limit?

No practical limit. We've tested with 2 million rows. Performance is constant due to virtual scrolling.

### Why is initial render slow?

- Generate data outside the component or use `useMemo`
- Use `shallowRef` for large arrays
- Check for expensive custom renderers
