## Legend

- **Higher is better** - For these metrics, larger values indicate better performance
- **Lower is better** - For these metrics, smaller values indicate better performance

### Metrics Explained

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Avg FPS** | Average frames per second during scroll |
| **Min FPS** | Minimum FPS observed (worst case) |
| **Frame Drops** | Number of frames that took >25ms |
| **P95 FPS** | 95th percentile FPS (excludes outliers) |
| **First Paint** | Time to first contentful paint |
| **Full Render** | Time until grid is fully interactive |
| **LCP** | Largest Contentful Paint |
| **TBT** | Total Blocking Time |
| **After Load** | Heap size after data is loaded |
| **Peak** | Maximum heap size during operation |
| **Growth Rate** | Memory increase per 1000 rows |
| **Retained** | Memory not released after clearing data |
