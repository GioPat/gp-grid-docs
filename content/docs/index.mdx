# gp-grid

A high-performance TypeScript data grid built on three core principles:

1. **Slot-Based Virtual Scrolling** - DOM elements are recycled rather than created/destroyed, maintaining consistent performance regardless of dataset size.

2. **Instruction-Based Architecture** - The core emits declarative instructions that framework adapters interpret, keeping rendering logic framework-agnostic.

3. **DataSource Abstraction** - Clean separation between data operations and UI, supporting both client-side and server-side data handling.

## Features

- Virtual scrolling with slot recycling
- Cell selection with range and multi-select
- Multi-column sorting
- Column filtering with debounced input
- Cell editing with fill handle
- Keyboard navigation
