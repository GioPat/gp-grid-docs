# gp-grid documentation

This project is the documentation of gp-grid: `https://github.com/GioPat/gp-grid`. GP grid has been built with the following principles in mind:

"A modern, lightweight, blazing fast and community driven (Apache 2.0) grid — no feature gating, no enterprise traps."

When we say lightweight we talk about also the dependencies. The library does not and won't use any external dependencies.

This is fumadocs project (based on NextJS).

Follows the atomic design principles

It uses bun as runtime.
